# House_Price_Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting house prices based on various features. The project implements a regression model to estimate the prices of houses using a dataset of real estate information from kaggle.

# Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

<kbd style="background-color: lightblue; padding: 10px;">**data/**:</kbd> This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
<kbd style="background-color: lightblue; padding: 10px;">**programs/**:</kbd> This directory contains the notebook of training machine learning model, The templates directory which contains web page files which are built using
HTML,CSS,JS. The .pkl file that has trained model. The clean data.
<kbd style="background-color: lightblue; padding: 10px;">**requirements.txt/**:</kbd> This file contains all the packages that are used in this project.


# Getting Started
To get started with the project. Do the following steps:-
1. Clone the repository:
    <kbd style="background-color: lightblue; padding: 10px;">https://github.com/qazi-humayoon/House_Price_Prediction.git </kbd>
2. Set up the Python environment with the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:
3. Run the  <kbd style="background-color: lightblue; padding: 10px;">programs/house_price_prediction.ipynb</kbd> sequentially to execute the code and reproduce the results.
